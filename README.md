# audio-denoise

a python program that takes a .wav file and denoise the audio using fast fourier transform. But there is a huge possibility that you might end up getting more noisy audio file :P however, it makes the audio file a little bit compressed (as it throws out some data of that audio file)

The funtion is implemented, you need to call the function with the proper arguments(filename: the audio file must be a .wav file and must be in the same directory,                                                                                     threshold value:i can't explaint it to you sorry).
